# Packet Capture and Analysis

This module covers packet capture and analysis in C++ with a focus on security applications. Understanding network traffic at the packet level is essential for security professionals who need to monitor networks, detect attacks, and analyze protocols.

## Contents

1. **packet_sniffer.cpp** - Basic packet sniffer using raw sockets
2. **pcap_analyzer.cpp** - Packet capture and analysis using libpcap
3. **protocol_analyzer.cpp** - Protocol-specific analysis for HTTP, DNS, and TLS

## Key Security Concepts

### 1. Packet Capture Techniques
The examples demonstrate different packet capture methods:
- Raw socket capture
- libpcap interface
- BPF filtering
- Protocol identification

### 2. Protocol Analysis
The protocol analyzer demonstrates:
- HTTP request/response parsing
- DNS query/response parsing
- TLS/SSL record analysis
- Protocol anomaly detection

### 3. Security Analysis
The examples include security-focused analysis:
- Detection of unencrypted protocols
- Identification of missing security headers
- Recognition of potential scanning activity
- Analysis of protocol anomalies

### 4. Traffic Statistics
The pcap analyzer provides:
- IP address statistics
- Protocol distribution
- Port usage analysis
- Traffic volume metrics

## Red Team Applications

These packet capture tools can be extended for red team operations:
- Network reconnaissance
- Protocol vulnerability identification
- Credential sniffing (in controlled environments)
- C2 channel development and testing
- Data exfiltration testing

## Compilation Instructions

### Raw Socket Packet Sniffer
```bash
g++ packet_sniffer.cpp -o packet_sniffer -std=c++11
