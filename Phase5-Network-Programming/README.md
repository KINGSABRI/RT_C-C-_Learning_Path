# Phase 5: Network Programming

This phase focuses on network programming with C/C++, applying the language skills developed in previous phases to networking and security applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand socket programming in C/C++
- Implement and analyze network protocols
- Develop packet capture and analysis tools
- Build a simple intrusion detection system
- Apply security principles to network programming

## Modules

### 1. Socket Programming

This module covers:
- Socket API basics
- TCP and UDP sockets
- Client-server architecture
- Non-blocking I/O
- Socket options and security
- Cross-platform socket programming

The example code demonstrates creating secure client-server applications, handling connections safely, and implementing proper error handling for network operations.

### 2. Network Protocols

This module covers:
- Protocol implementation in C/C++
- HTTP, DNS, and other common protocols
- Protocol parsing and validation
- Protocol security considerations
- Custom protocol development

The example code demonstrates implementing and analyzing network protocols, with a focus on security validation, input sanitization, and handling malformed protocol data.

### 3. Packet Capture and Analysis

This module covers:
- Raw socket programming
- Using libpcap/WinPcap
- Packet structure and parsing
- Protocol analysis
- Network traffic monitoring

The example code demonstrates capturing and analyzing network packets, extracting protocol information, and identifying potential security issues in network traffic.

### 4. Simple Intrusion Detection System

This module covers:
- Network-based attack detection
- Traffic pattern analysis
- Signature-based detection
- Anomaly detection basics
- Alert generation and logging

The example code demonstrates building a simple intrusion detection system that monitors network traffic, detects common attack patterns, and generates security alerts.

## Security Concepts

Throughout this phase, you'll learn about:
- Network security fundamentals
- Secure socket programming
- Protocol security and validation
- Network-based attacks and detection
- Defensive network programming

## Practice Projects

The major projects in this phase include:

1. **Secure Chat Application**
  - Implements encrypted client-server communication
  - Handles authentication and session management
  - Validates all network input
  - Implements proper error handling for network operations

2. **Simple Network Intrusion Detection System**
  - Captures and analyzes network packets
  - Detects common attack signatures
  - Monitors for suspicious traffic patterns
  - Generates and logs security alerts

These projects provide hands-on experience with network programming in a security context, demonstrating how to build secure networked applications and security monitoring tools.
