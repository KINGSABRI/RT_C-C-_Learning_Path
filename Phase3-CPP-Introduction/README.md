# Phase 3: Introduction to C++

This phase introduces C++ programming with a focus on object-oriented programming and the Standard Template Library (STL), continuing the cybersecurity emphasis.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand C++ basics and object-oriented programming concepts
- Master the Standard Template Library (STL) for efficient data structures and algorithms
- Apply C++ features to security-focused applications
- Implement practical security projects using C++

## Modules

### 1. C++ Basics and Object-Oriented Programming

This module covers:
- C++ syntax and differences from C
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and data hiding
- Smart pointers and memory management

The example code demonstrates a security system with classes for security events, users, and logging, showcasing object-oriented design principles.

### 2. Standard Template Library (STL)

This module covers:
- STL containers (vector, list, map, set)
- STL algorithms
- Iterators
- Function objects and lambdas
- STL applications for security

The example code demonstrates using STL containers and algorithms for intrusion detection and password management systems.

### 3. Secure Password Manager (Practice Project)

This module applies C++ concepts to build a secure password manager:
- Password encryption and decryption
- Password strength checking
- Secure password generation
- Password categories and organization
- Secure memory handling

The password manager project demonstrates practical security applications using C++ features, including encryption, secure data handling, and user interface design.

### 4. Network Packet Analyzer (Practice Project)

This module applies C++ concepts to build a network packet analyzer:
- Packet structure parsing
- Protocol analysis
- Network security concepts
- Data visualization
- Security analysis

The packet analyzer project demonstrates how to parse and analyze network packets, which is essential for network security monitoring and intrusion detection.

## Security Concepts

Throughout this phase, you'll learn about:
- Object-oriented design for security applications
