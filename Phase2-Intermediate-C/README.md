# Phase 2: Intermediate C

## Introduction

This phase builds upon the C fundamentals and introduces more advanced concepts with a security focus. You'll learn about complex data structures, file operations, advanced memory management, and practical security applications in C.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will:
- Master structures and complex data types
- Implement secure file operations
- Apply advanced memory management techniques
- Understand common security vulnerabilities at a deeper level
- Develop practical security tools in C

## Modules

### 01-Structures
Covers structures, unions, and complex data types, with a focus on memory layout and potential security implications.

### 02-FileOperations
Explores file I/O operations in C, focusing on secure file handling, permission issues, and common vulnerabilities.

### 03-AdvancedMemory
Covers advanced memory management techniques, including custom allocators, memory pools, and secure memory handling.

### 04-Preprocessor
Explores the C preprocessor, macros, conditional compilation, and their security implications.

### 05-SecurityTools
Practical exercises to build simple security tools, including a memory scanner and file integrity checker.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Phase 1: C Fundamentals
- Understanding of basic C syntax and concepts
- Familiarity with memory management in C
- GCC compiler installed

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (GCC recommended)
2. For Windows users, consider using WSL or MinGW
3. Each module has its own directory with code examples and exercises
4. Compile examples using the provided Makefile or compilation commands

## Red Team Applications

The intermediate C skills learned in this phase enable:
- Development of more sophisticated security tools
- Implementation of custom memory manipulation techniques
- Creation of file-based persistence mechanisms
- Analysis and modification of binary files
- Understanding of more complex vulnerabilities

## Security Considerations

1. The examples in this phase demonstrate both secure and insecure coding practices
2. Always practice in controlled, legal environments
3. Use the knowledge gained to improve security, not to exploit systems without authorization
4. Be aware of the legal implications of developing security tools
