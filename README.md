```shellscript
pacman -Syu
```

```shellscript
# For 64-bit development
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain // Choose the default options (all packages)
```

**Using CMake with MSYS2**

For more complex projects, you can use CMake:

```shellscript
# Navigate to a project directory
cd /c/path/to/C-CPP-Learning-Path/Phase4-Advanced-CPP

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Generate Makefiles
cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"

# Build the project
cmake --build .
```

### Compilation Tips for MSYS2

1. **Use the correct shell**: Always use the "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" shell for compilation, not the regular MSYS2 shell.
2. **Path conversion**: MSYS2 automatically converts Unix-style paths to Windows paths. If you have issues, use explicit Windows paths with forward slashes:

```shellscript
gcc C:/path/to/file.c -o output.exe
```

3. **Common GCC flags**:

- `-Wall -Wextra`: Enable important warnings
- `-Werror`: Treat warnings as errors
- `-std=c++17`: Use C++17 standard (for C++ files)
- `-g`: Add debugging information
- `-O2`: Optimize code (level 2)
- `-fstack-protector-all`: Stack protection
- `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`: Additional security checks
- `Woverflow`: Disable overflow warnings (if needed)
- `-fPIC`: Position-independent code (for shared libraries)
- `-shared`: Create a shared library

4. **Windows-specific libraries**:

- `-lws2_32`: Winsock (network programming)
- `-ladvapi32`: Advanced Windows APIs
- `-luser32`: User interface APIs
- `-lkernel32`: Core Windows APIs
- `-lpsapi`: Process Status API

5. **Handling spaces in paths**: If your path contains spaces, use quotes:

```shellscript
gcc "C:/My Projects/file.c" -o output.exe
```


### Troubleshooting MSYS2 Compilation Issues

1. **"Command not found"**: Ensure you're using the MinGW shell and the toolchain is installed:

```shellscript
which gcc
which g++
```


2. **Missing libraries**: Install required packages:

```shellscript
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-<package-name>
```


3. **Path issues**: Check your PATH environment variable:

```shellscript
echo $PATH
```


4. **DLL not found when running**: Add MinGW bin directory to Windows PATH or copy required DLLs to the same directory as your executable.
5. **Permission denied**: Check file permissions or try running as administrator.
