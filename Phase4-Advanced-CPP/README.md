# Phase 4: Advanced C++

This phase explores advanced C++ features with a continued focus on security applications, building on the object-oriented and STL foundations from Phase 3.

## Learning Objectives

- Master advanced C++ features like templates and metaprogramming
- Understand exception handling for robust error management
- Implement memory management with smart pointers
- Develop thread-safe code for concurrent applications
- Apply these concepts to security-focused applications

## Modules

### 1. Templates and Metaprogramming

This module covers:
- Function templates
- Class templates
- Template specialization
- Variadic templates
- Compile-time programming
- Type traits and SFINAE
- Security applications of templates

The example code demonstrates how to create generic security components using templates, such as type-safe containers for sensitive data and compile-time security checks.

### 2. Exception Handling

This module covers:
- Try-catch blocks
- Exception hierarchies
- Custom exceptions
- Exception safety guarantees
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Security implications of exceptions

The example code demonstrates proper exception handling in security-critical code, including resource management, error recovery, and secure cleanup operations.

### 3. Smart Pointers and Memory Management

This module covers:
- std::unique_ptr
- std::shared_ptr
- std::weak_ptr
- Custom deleters
- Memory ownership models
- Preventing memory leaks and dangling pointers

The example code demonstrates using smart pointers for secure memory management in security applications, preventing common vulnerabilities like use-after-free and memory leaks.

### 4. Thread Safety and Concurrency

This module covers:
- Multithreading basics
- Mutexes and locks
- Atomic operations
- Thread-local storage
- Race conditions and deadlocks
- Thread safety in security applications

The example code demonstrates building thread-safe security components, including concurrent logging, thread-safe credential management, and race condition prevention.

## Security Concepts

Throughout this phase, you'll learn about:
- Type safety and compile-time security checks
- Robust error handling for security applications
- Memory safety through modern C++ techniques
- Thread safety in security-critical code
- Secure coding patterns in modern C++

## Practice Projects

The major projects in this phase include:

1. **Secure Configuration Manager**
  - Uses templates for type-safe configuration
  - Implements exception handling for robust error management
  - Uses smart pointers for memory safety
  - Provides thread-safe access to configuration

2. **Thread-Safe Logging System**
  - Implements a concurrent logging system
  - Uses smart pointers for resource management
  - Handles exceptions properly
  - Prevents race conditions and deadlocks

These projects provide hands-on experience with advanced C++ features in security-relevant contexts, preparing you for real-world security application development.
