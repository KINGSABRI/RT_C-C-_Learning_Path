# API Hooking

This module covers various API hooking techniques used in Windows programming. API hooking is a powerful technique that allows you to intercept and modify the behavior of API calls. It is commonly used in security research, malware analysis, reverse engineering, and for implementing various security tools.

## Overview

API hooking involves intercepting calls to API functions and redirecting them to your own code. This allows you to:
- Monitor API calls
- Modify parameters or return values
- Implement custom behavior
- Bypass security mechanisms
- Hide activities from detection

## Techniques Covered

### 1. Inline Hooking

Inline hooking involves modifying the first few bytes of a target function to redirect execution to your hook function. This is one of the most common hooking techniques.

```cpp
// Basic inline hook pattern
void* originalFunction = GetProcAddress(hModule, "TargetFunction");
BYTE jumpInstruction[5] = {0xE9, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}; // JMP instruction
DWORD jumpOffset = (DWORD)((BYTE*)hookFunction - (BYTE*)originalFunction - 5);
memcpy(jumpInstruction + 1, &jumpOffset, sizeof(jumpOffset));
